There are costs to ensuring sustainability in this sense over and above the costs of preservation. The project's sustainability plan should therefore be proportionate to the envisaged longer-term value of the data for the research community and should be closely related to your plans for dissemination and Pathways to Impact.</p><p>If you believe that digital outputs should not be sustained beyond the period of funding then this should be justified. It is not mandatory to sustain all digital outputs. While you should consider the long-term value of the digital outputs to the research community, where they are purely ancillary to a project’s research outputs there may not be a case for sustaining them (though there would usually be a case for preservation).</p><p>You must consider the sustainability of your digital outputs in five ways: what, where, how, for how long, and how the cost will be covered. You must make appropriate provision for user consultation and user testing in this connection, and plan the development of suitable user documentation.</p><p>You should provide justification if you do not envisage open, public access. A case can be made for charging for or otherwise limiting access, but the default expectation is that access will be open. The Technical Reviewer will be looking for realistic commitments to sustaining public access in line with affordability and the longer-term value of the digital output.</p><p>You must consider any institutional support needed in order to carry out these plans, if not covered under Section 3, as well as the cost of keeping the digital output publicly available in the future, including issues relating to maintenance, infrastructure and upgrade (such as the need to modify aspects of a web interface or software application in order to account for changes in the technological environment). In order to minimise sustainability costs, it is generally useful that the expertise involved in the development of your project is supported by expertise in your own or a partner institution.</p><p>A sustainability plan does not necessarily mean a requirement to generate income or prevent resources from being freely available. Rather it is a requirement to consider the direct costs and expertise of maintaining digital outputs for continued access. Some applicants might be able to demonstrate that there will be no significant sustainability problems with their digital output; in some cases the university’s computing services or library might provide a firm commitment to sustaining the resource for a specified period; others might see the benefit of Open Source community development models. You should provide reassurances of sustainability which are proportionate to the envisaged longer-term value of the digital outputs for the research community.</p><p>When completing this section, you should consider the potential impact of the data on research in your field (if research in the discipline will be improved through the creation of the digital output, how will it be affected if the resource then disappears?), and make the necessary connections with your Impact Plan. You must factor in the effects of any IP, copyright and ethical issues during the period in which the digital output will be publicly accessible, connecting what you say with the relevant part of your Case for Support.</p><p>You must identify whether or not you envisage the academic content (as distinct from the technology) of the digital output being extended or updated beyond the period of funding, addressing the following issues: how this will be done, by who and at what cost. You will need to show how the cost of this will be sustained after the period of funding ends.</p>"

Researchers have a legitimate interest in benefiting from their own time and effort in producing data, but not in prolonged exclusive use of these data. BBSRC expects that all data (with accompanying metadata) should be shared in a timely fashion as soon as it is verified. It is expected that timely release would generally be no later than the release through publication of the main findings and should be in-line with established best practice in the field. Where best practices does not exist release within three years of generation of the dataset is suggested as a guide. </p><p>The timescale for release for the data may differ for several reasons, depending on the nature of the data. These reasons may include: <ul><li><strong>Scientific Area:</strong> Researchers are expected to make data available in-line with established practices within the relevant research community. Examples include: <ul><li>Crystallography (Protein Data Bank) - the community has agreed a maximum 12-month delay between publishing the first paper on a structure and making coordinates public for secondary use. </li><li>Sequencing (EMBL Nucleotide Sequence database) – submitted data can be withheld from public access until publication of results but no later. </li><li>Metabolomics (MeT-RO) – Up to a six-month delay in publication can be requested. </li><li>Arabidopsis microarray data (NASC Affymetrix service) – all data are made available after a maximum one-year confidential period. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Intellectual Property (IP) issues and potential for commercialisation of research outputs:</strong> New knowledge generates patentable ideas. BBSRC is also driving a policy of Knowledge Transfer and strongly encourages the commercialisation of IP through various initiatives. BBSRC recognises the need for periods of exclusive use of data but considers that commercialisation of research does not preclude data sharing and should not unduly delay or prevent data sharing. Any IP issues or plans for commercialisation should be highlighted in the case for support of the grant application. </li><li><strong>Length or scope of research project:</strong> Data from large studies may be released in waves as they become available or as they are published.</li></ul></p>"

./test/fixtures/questions.yml:321:  guidance: "<p>Data which might have the potential to be exploited commercially or otherwise to deliver patient benefit should be discussed with your technology transfer office and Cancer Research Technology prior to data sharing. Cancer Research UK encourages the appropriate filing of patents and recognises that there may be a need to delay the release of data until patent applications have been filed. Whilst there may be a delay in the release of data due to the application process, appropriate intellectual property protection should not hinder data sharing and may be the best way of ensuring that patient (and public) benefit is delivered. Any intellectual property issues or plans for commercialisation that may affect data sharing should be addressed in the data sharing plan. Cancer Research UK understands that unexpected intellectual property may arise during the course of the study and investigators may need to depart from their data sharing plan to protect intellectual property and for any other necessary steps to be taken. Data sharing may also be affected when co-funding is provided by the private sector (e.g. by a pharmaceutical company) or host institution resulting in some restrictions on the disclosure of data. For example with clinical trials, the Trial Management Group and/or trial sponsor etc may impose restrictions on data access. Any restrictions should be outlined in the data sharing plan and applicants should explore ways data sharing requests can be considered by the body that owns the data.</p> <p class='guidance_header'>e.g. Development arrangements through Cancer Research Technology including intellectual property protection and commercialisation</p> <p class='guidance_header'>e.g. Proprietary Data - restrictions due to collaborations with for profit organisations International policies governing the sharing of data collected outside of the UK</p> <p>My research seeks supports from both the public and private sectors. How do I deal with the sharing of data? Where research is funded by a commercial sponsor, restrictions on data sharing may apply in arrangements agreed with the sponsor. Any such restriction(s) should be highlighted in the data management and sharing plan. In the event that researchers apply for or receive commercial funding for any part of their research that Cancer Research UK supports they should advise Cancer Research Technology of the situation without delay.</p> <p class='guidance_header'>e.g. Confidentiality, ethical or consent issues that may arise with the use of data involving human subjects.</p> <p>Investigators carrying out research involving human participants must ensure that consent is obtained to share information; furthermore the necessary legal, ethical and regulatory permissions regarding data sharing should be in place prior to disclosing any data. Every effort must be made to protect the identity of participants and, prior to sharing, data should be anonymised. In addition, any indirect identifiers that may lead to deductive disclosures should be removed to reduce the risk of identification. In most instances, sharing data should be possible without compromising the confidentiality of participants but if there are circumstances where data needs to be restricted due to the inability to protect confidentiality this should be fully addressed in the data management and sharing plan.</p>"
