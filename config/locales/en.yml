    title: "About Software Management Plan Service"
    body_text_html: "<div class='white_background'>
    <p>It is easy to concentrate on the short-term issues when developing research software. Deadlines for publications, collaboration with others and the demands of a daily routine all conspire to prevent proper planning. A software management plan can help to formalise a set of structures and goals that ensure your software is accessible and reusable in the short, medium and long term.</p>
    <p>At present software management plans are relatively new for research software proposals, though many of their elements would be expected in standard proposals.</p>
    <p>Software Management Plan Service is a prototype service developed by the UK's <a href='http://www.software.ac.uk/' target=_'blank'>Software Sustainability Institute</a> to help researchers understand what software management plans involve, why they are important and how to write them. It is also intended to help us gather requirements from researchers, funders and other stakeholders as to what software management plans should include, how they overlap with data management plans, and how to promote their uptake.</p>
    <p>It is powered by <a href='https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk' target='_blank'>DMPonline</a> developed by the UK's <a href='http://www.dcc.ac.uk' target='_blank'>Digital Curation Centre</a>. The Digital Curation Centre worked closely with research funders and universities to produce DMPonline to help researchers to produce an effective data management plan (DMP) to cater for the whole lifecycle of a project, from bid-preparation stage through to completion.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Why develop this prototype?</h3>
    <div class='white_background'>
    <p>In October 2012, we produced a guide to <a target='_blank' href='http://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/software-management-plans'>Writing and using a software management plan</a>. This was influenced by work by the Digital Curation Centre on data management plans.</p>
    <p>We have provided similar advice for doing sustainability evaluations. What was initially a subjective process carried out by staff was documented as a <a target='_blank' href='http://www.software.ac.uk/software-evaluation-guide'>Software Evaluation Guide</a>. This was then implemented as a <a target='_blank' href='http://www.software.ac.uk/online-sustainability-evaluation'>Online Sustainablity Evaluation</a> where a researcher completes a form and gets an auto-generated report containing boiler-plate advice and guidance on how to improve their sustainability .</p>
    <p>A comparable service, for software management plans, was requested by our advisory board in Autumn 2012 and also by attendees (researchers and leaders) at our <a target='_blank' href='http://www.software.ac.uk/cw12'>Collaborations Workshop 2012</a>.</p>
    <p>Rather than creating yet another product from scratch, we decided to practice what we preach in terms of reusing research outputs and, after an initial evaluation, decided to rebrand and retask DMPonline.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>How the tool works</h3>
    <div class='white_background'>
    <p>There are a number of templates within the service that represent the requirements of different funders and institutions. Users are asked three questions at the outset so we can determine the appropriate template to display (e.g. the ESRC template when applying for an ESRC grant). Guidance is provided to help you interpret and answer the questions. This guidance is provided by researcher funders, universities and disciplines.</p>

    <div class='white_background'>
    <p>Software Management Plan Service is a prototype. It is designed to help us gather requirements from researchers, funders and other stakeholders as to what software management plans should include, how they overlap with data management plans, and how to promote their uptake. We welcome any suggestions as to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>What software management plans should include.</li>
    <li>What advice should be given to researchers to help them understand, and write, effective software management plans.</li>
    <li>How useful a Software Management Service would be to researchers, funders and other stakeholders.</li>
    <li>What functionality a service such as the Software Management Service should support.</li>
    <li>How software and data management plans overlap, what aspects are software-only, what are data-only and how to provide a unified service that supports both software and data management plans. We are working closely with the Digital Curation Centre to understand such issues.</li>
    </ul>
