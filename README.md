# Software Management Plan Service

Repository for work relating to development of a software management plan service, by the [Software Sustainability Institute](http://www.software.ac.uk). The goals of this work are to:

* Develop a service to allow researchers to write software management plans, which supports both generic and funder-specific plans and provides generic and funder-specific advice and guidance. 
* Design and promote the service as an online tutorial to educate researchers in what software management plans involve, why they are important and how to write them. It should not be viewed as a "tick box" service that researchers can use to create a document that helps them get funding.

The work seeks to use the [Digital Curation Centre](http://www.dcc.ac.uk)'s [DMPonline](https://github.com/DigitalCurationCentre/DMPonline_v4) as a framework to implement the service.
